The purpose of this module is to detect steganography in PDF documents, specifically targeting completely concealed PNG images hidden within PDF files (not as visible content). Core Requirements Application Structure Name the Django app 'stego_ai', Design it as a self-contained module that can integrate with a larger Django project Include all necessary models, views, templates, static files, and API endpoints Implement proper Django app structure with appropriate separation of concerns Machine Learning Capabilities Implement two advanced ML models for steganography detection: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) with attention mechanisms An Ensemble model combining XGBoost and LSTM for complementary detection approaches Design both models to detect even encrypted and compressed steganographic content Create a complete ML pipeline including preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and inference Training Infrastructure Develop a system for uploading and managing training datasets Implement a training pipeline that allows users to select a folder with training data Create a dataset preprocessing system that can extract appropriate features from PDFs Include functionality to split data into training/validation/test sets Implement model training with progress monitoring and early stopping Develop model evaluation tools with appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC curves) Detection System Create a file upload interface for submitting PDFs for analysis Implement a detection pipeline that processes PDFs through both models Design a confidence scoring system to evaluate detection certainty Build visualizations to help understand detection results Include batch processing capabilities for analyzing multiple files User Interface Design an intuitive interface for dataset management Create a training dashboard with real-time progress monitoring Develop a model evaluation dashboard showing performance metrics Implement a detection interface with clear results visualization Include system configuration options for advanced users Technical Specifications Feature Engineering Implement entropy analysis of PDF byte streams Create extractors for structural anomalies in PDF objects Develop analysis for compression inconsistencies Include statistical pattern detection in binary data Implement wavelet and Fourier transformation features Data Requirements Support for datasets with at least 10,000 PDF documents Handle various PDF types (text-heavy, image-heavy, forms, mixed) Support multiple PDF versions (1.3 through 2.0) Process files ranging from 100KB to 100MB Include data augmentation capabilities Performance Considerations Implement asynchronous processing using Celery for large files Use Redis for task queue management Support GPU acceleration where available Include batch processing for multiple files Implement caching strategies for improved performance Security Measures Isolate execution environment for untrusted files Encrypt model weights to protect intellectual property Implement comprehensive logging for audit trails Include proper authentication and authorization Add rate limiting for API endpoints Implementation Guidelines Start by creating the Django app structure and database models Implement the PDF processing and feature extraction pipelines Develop the machine learning models as specified Create the training infrastructure Implement the detection system Design and develop the user interfaces Integrate with the larger application through well-defined APIs Add comprehensive tests for all components Document the codebase and provide usage instructions Please provide complete, well-commented code for all components, with special attention to making the code maintainable and extensible. Include appropriate requirements files and deployment instructions. The application should be modular enough that it can function independently but also integrate seamlessly with the larger Django project."},
